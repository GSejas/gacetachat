### Overview
OpenAI committed $50 million in July 2025 to support nonprofits and mission-focused organizations working at the intersection of innovation and public good.

### Key Details

### Focus Areas

#### 1. AI Literacy & Public Understanding ✅ STRONG FIT
Supporting organizations that help communities build the knowledge, skills, and confidence to navigate the age of artificial intelligence.

**How GacetaChat Aligns**:
- Teaches citizens how AI can democratize access to government information
- Demonstrates practical AI use for civic participation
- Shows NGOs how to leverage AI for advocacy work
- Builds AI literacy through transparent, explainable summarization

#### 2. Community Innovation ✅ PERFECT FIT
Supporting organizations that work in partnership with communities to guide how AI might be shaped and used in their lives, with priority on efforts where communities lead participatory design and decision-making to ensure AI strengthens civic life.

**How GacetaChat Aligns**:

- **Community-Led**: NGOs decide what keywords to monitor, what alerts to set
- **Participatory Decision-Making**: Alpha users influence feature development
- **Strengthens Civic Life**: Direct impact on democratic participation
- **Theory of Change**: NGOs → Media/Advocacy → Citizens → Democracy

## GacetaChat's Unique Value Proposition for OpenAI

### 1. Democratic Infrastructure (Not Just an App)
- Public good infrastructure for Costa Rican civil society
- Open source (MIT License) - replicable for other countries
- No user lock-in, no commercial exploitation
- Designed to empower intermediaries (NGOs), not extract value

### 2. AI for Democratic Participation
- Addresses real information asymmetry (corporations monitor La Gaceta, citizens can't)
- AI makes government transparency actionable (50-200 pages → 30 seconds)
- Measurable democratic impact (NGO response time, policy comments, media stories)
- Aligns with OpenAI's mission of beneficial AI

### 3. Community Innovation Model
- **Co-design with NGOs**: Alpha pilot with 2-3 environmental NGOs
- **Participatory**: NGOs lead feature prioritization (not developers)
- **Transparency**: Page references, prompt versioning, cost tracking
- **Accountability**: Open source allows community audit and improvement

### 4. Cost-Effective & Sustainable
- **$2/year** for daily AI summaries (GPT-5 Mini)
- 88% cost reduction from initial design
- Proves AI can be accessible without venture capital
- Model for sustainable civic tech

### 5. Proven Approach
- **Working demo**: https://gacetachat.streamlit.app/
- **Live data**: Daily scraper generating real summaries
- **Test infrastructure**: 26 tests, CI/CD, cost tracking
- **Strategic planning**: NGO expert analysis (50-year veteran, MIT)
- **Technical excellence**: Modern stack, reproducible, documented

## Application Strategy

### Eligibility Challenge
**Problem**: GacetaChat is Costa Rica-focused, but OpenAI requires U.S.-focused work.

**Solutions**:
1. **U.S. Fiscal Sponsor**:
   - Partner with U.S.-based 501(c)(3) that supports international civic tech
   - Examples: Code for America, Mozilla Foundation, Sunlight Foundation
   - They apply on our behalf, we execute the work

2. **U.S. Replication Component**:
   - Add component for replicating GacetaChat in U.S. contexts
   - E.g., Federal Register summarization for U.S. NGOs
   - Costa Rica as proof-of-concept, U.S. as primary beneficiary

3. **AI Literacy Focus**:
   - Position as teaching U.S. NGOs how to replicate this approach
   - Workshops, documentation, toolkit for civic tech in U.S.
   - Costa Rica as case study that benefits U.S. civil society

**Recommended Approach**: Option 2 (U.S. Replication) + Option 3 (AI Literacy)

### Grant Ask Amount
- **Operating Budget Assumption**: $30,000/year (MVP operations)
- **10% Cap**: $3,000 maximum grant
- **Alternative**: Define larger operating budget ($100k) to justify $10k grant

**Recommended Ask**: $10,000
- **Justification**: Supports MVP development + U.S. replication pilot
- **Operating Budget**: $100,000 (includes staff, infrastructure, expansion)
- **10% = $10,000**

### Narrative Positioning

**Headline**: "Community-Led AI for Democratic Participation"

**Hook**: "What if every NGO could afford to monitor government the way corporations do?"

**Problem**: Information asymmetry weakens democracy. Corporations have teams monitoring government publications. NGOs and citizens can't keep up.

**Solution**: GacetaChat uses AI to level the playing field. Costa Rican environmental NGOs can now monitor La Gaceta (50-200 daily pages) in 30 seconds.

**Community Innovation**:
- NGOs co-design features (keyword alerts, trend analysis)
- Participatory decision-making (pilot users vote on roadmap)
- Open source allows community ownership and improvement
- Theory of Change puts NGOs at center (not individual users)

**AI Literacy**:
- Demonstrates how AI can democratize information access
- Teaches NGOs to leverage AI for advocacy
- Shows citizens how AI can strengthen democracy (not just threaten it)
- Provides replication toolkit for U.S. NGOs

**Impact**:
- Faster NGO response to environmental threats
- More media stories on government actions
- Increased public comment on regulations
- Stronger democratic participation

**Sustainability**: $2/year for AI costs. Designed to last forever, not raise Series A.

## Alternative: OpenAI API Credits Grant

### Historical Examples
- Past programs offered $10,000 in API credits for prize winners
- $2,500 in API credits for grantees
- Sometimes paired with cash grants

### GacetaChat's Ask
**$5,000 in API credits** = 2,500 years of daily summaries (at $2/year)

**Use Case**:
1. Costa Rica daily summaries (365/year) = $2/year
2. U.S. Federal Register pilot (daily) = $2/year
3. 5 other Latin American countries (daily) = $10/year
4. API access for 100 NGO partners = Free tier
5. Training workshops (test data) = $100/year
6. Research/evaluation = $100/year

**Total annual usage**: ~$214/year

**$5,000 credits** = 23 years of multi-country operation

**Why This Works**:
- Extremely cost-effective for OpenAI (tiny cost compared to cash)
- Massive impact for GacetaChat (enables regional expansion)
- Demonstrates OpenAI API for civic good (marketing value)
- No cash required (easier approval)
